## The Data Behind Space Exploration with NASA

Data science is a field that influences all aspects of our scientific community, including space exploration. Inspired by NASA, weâ€™ve developed new content for analyzing space rocks and determining the likelihood of a successful rocket launch into space.

[Join this session](https://myignite.microsoft.com/sessions/b0527d73-b179-4220-a096-cb48a160040e) to explore this data and to perhaps develop your own space exploration study using Visual Studio Code and a bit of Python. This session recommends a basic understanding of Visual Studio Code and Python programming.

- **Session Type:** Learning Zone
- **Level:** Foundational (100)
- **Theme:** Developer and Student
